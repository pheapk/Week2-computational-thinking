Objects - Step 2

Adding to Objects
To add properties to objects, it is best to do so using the . operator.

Note: Properties are key: value pair entries in objects. For example, name: 'Isaac Asimov'

let person = {
    name: 'Isaac Asimov',
    occupation: 'science fiction writer',
}
 
person.number_of_books = 500
This code will result in adding the key "number_of_books" to the object person, and assign a value of "500" to that key. The new object will look like this:

person = {
    name: 'Isaac Asimov',
    occupation: 'science fiction writer',
    number_of_books: 500
}
Removing Keys from Objects
We can remove a key from an object by using the delete keyword.

let person = {
    name: 'Isaac Asimov',
    occupation: 'science novels writer',
    number_of_books: 500,
    university: 'University of Toronto'
}
delete person.university; // returns true
This will remove the key:value pair "university: University of Toronto" from the person object.

Task Instructions
Given the bike object, open the objects-02 folder, in main.js, change the speed value to 12, and then return the new value.

When you're done, check the task as completed.
